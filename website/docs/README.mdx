## What is Shield?

Shield is a GraphQL library that helps you create a permission layer for your server.
Its main focus is creating a meaningful, well-rounded and scalable API that will make you
confident about your permission layer.

Using an intuitive rule-first API, you'll be able to define the collection of rules
that you can use across your permission system.

## Features

- **Flexible:** Based on [GraphQL Middleware](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-middleware).
- **Compatible:** Works with all GraphQL Servers.
- **Smart:** Intelligent V8 Shield engine caches all your request to prevent any unnecessary load.
- **Per-Type or Per-Field:** Write permissions for your schema, types or specific fields.

## Installation

Start by adding GraphQL Shield to your server:

<PackageInstall packageName="graphql-shield" />

## Example

Here's an example of how you can define permissions using GraphQL Shield

```ts
const isAuthenticated = rule({ cache: 'contextual' })(async (parent, args, ctx, info) => {
  return ctx.user !== null
})

const isAdmin = rule({ cache: 'contextual' })(async (parent, args, ctx, info) => {
  return ctx.user.role === 'admin'
})

const isEditor = rule({ cache: 'contextual' })(async (parent, args, ctx, info) => {
  return ctx.user.role === 'editor'
})

// Permissions

const permissions = shield({
  Query: {
    frontPage: not(isAuthenticated),
    fruits: and(isAuthenticated, or(isAdmin, isEditor)),
    customers: and(isAuthenticated, isAdmin),
  },
  Mutation: {
    addFruitToBasket: isAuthenticated,
  },
  Fruit: isAuthenticated,
  Customer: isAdmin,
})
```
