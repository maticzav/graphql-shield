# [RFC] An effect rule, that would allow modification of arguments

There seem to be many use cases where having an abstraction that would allow for changing the arguments would come in handy.
Even though I was always averse to the idea of GraphQL Shield interacting with the business logic, the many use cases outweight
my prior dicisions.

## Overview

A new rule type, called `effect` would make it possible for developers to change the input a particular resolver would receive.

## Spec

```ts
```
